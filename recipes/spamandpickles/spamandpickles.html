        <h2>This is almost enough Spam to get me through a week.</h2>
        <p>If you're trying to keep strict keto macros, nothing works better than Spam and pickles!
            The Spam is almost exactly 80% fat and 20% protein by calories, so if you add a little fat 
            and some pickles for salt, you have a great keto meal.
        </p>
        <p>This recipe uses cream cheese for added fat and olives and other garnishes for extra flavor.
            Don't forget to add sodium and potassium!
        </p>
